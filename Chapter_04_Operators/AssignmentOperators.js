/*Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
They can also be combined with arithmetic operations to modify the value of a variable in place. Here are some common assignment operators:     
1. = (Simple Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
    Example:
    let x = 5; // x is now 5

2. += (Addition Assignment): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    Example:
    let x = 5;
    x += 3; // x is now 8    

3. -= (Subtraction Assignment): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    Example:
    let x = 5;
    x -= 2; // x is now 3   
4. *= (Multiplication Assignment): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    Example:
    let x = 5;
    x *= 4; // x is now 20
5. /= (Division Assignment): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    Example:
    let x = 20;
    x /= 5; // x is now 4
6. %= (Modulus Assignment): Takes the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    Example:
    let x = 10;
    x %= 3; // x is now 1
